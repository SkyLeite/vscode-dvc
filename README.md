## What it does (extension features)

The DVC Extension augments and adds several [Views], adds special [Editors].
Furthermore it exposes these and other DVC functions in the [Command Palette].
Specifically:

- It provides _Editors_ to manage [Experiments][exp-view] and display
  [Plots][plots-view] as _Tabs_ in the IDE.
- Adds a [DVC Tracked] panel to the _Explorer_ view. This shows a tree of the
  data that DVC is tracking, with real-time file/dir [states] and options to
  [synchronize] them (from/to remote storage).
- Adds a [DVC panel] to the _Source Control_ view to list the [workspace
  status]. You can [restore] or reset project versions (based on the current Git
  `HEAD` commit) as well as [manage new and existing data] from here.
- Adds a brand-new [DVC View]
  (<img src="docs/dvc.png" alt="DVC icon" height="1em"/> in the Activity Bar)
  with panels to visualize and manage [DVC Experiments].
- Registers several [commands] in the _Command Palette_.
- Includes a [DVC channel] for the _Output_ panel (useful for
  [debugging](#debugging)).

## Debugging

Due to the way DVC pipelines run scripts of any language from the command line,
users must debug pipeline scripts (e.g. `train.py`) standalone in whatever way
debuggers are run on the base language - this is standard for debugging DVC
pipelines, and most scripts are capable of running outside of DVC.

## Data and telemetry

The DVC Extension for Visual Studio Code collects usage data and sends it to
Azure to help improve our products and services. This extension respects the
`telemetry.enableTelemetry` setting which you can learn more about at
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting.
